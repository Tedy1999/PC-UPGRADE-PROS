      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p><strong>AnalytiQ was founded by Langelihle Mtungwa and Simon Ngubane</strong> both dedicated Master’s students at the University of Zululand AnalytiQ was born out of a shared passion to empower researchers with the skills they need to excel. With deep, practical expertise in SPSS, NVivo, EndNote, Mendeley, and Zotero, they recognized a critical gap: many struggle to unlock the full potential of these powerful tools, hindering their academic and professional progress.</p>
      <p>Driven by this insight, they committed themselves to creating tailored, hands-on training that transforms complexity into clarity. Through AnalytiQ, they have successfully helped numerous postgraduate students, academics, and professionals overcome challenges, gain confidence, and streamline their research workflows. Their approach is rooted in empathy, real-world experience, and a steadfast commitment to every learner’s success making AnalytiQ a trusted partner in advancing knowledge and research excellence.</p>
